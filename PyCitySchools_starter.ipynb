    "- \tFindings: On average, District schools have a higher total school budget, but are much larger schools. There seems to be a correlation between school size and average passing score. Charter schools on average, have less students, but a higher passing averages for math and reading. There does not seem to be any correlation in passing rate and per student budget. We can come to the conclusion that smaller class sizes have a better passing rate likely due to more one on one time between students and teachers. \n",

    "Highest Performing Schools by % Overalll Passing\n",
    "\tTop 5 highest performing schools were all charter schools. School budget and per student budget do not seem to have an effect on performance since Pena High School had about half the budget as the other charter schools and is still in the top 5 best performing.\n",

    "Bottom Performing Schools by % Overall Passing:\n",
    "\tThe lowest performing schools were all District Schools, even with a higher than normal Per student budget. It appears that on average, larger schools have lower overall passing rates\n",
